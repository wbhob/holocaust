                    <p>Technology and machinery have made killing large groups of us easier. Explosives, firearms, and chemical

                    <p>
                        As with most genocides, it all began from suspicion. A new political party, the <i>Young Turks</i>,
                        in the Ottoman Empire, were rising to power by instilling fear and suspicion against the government
                        and against their neighboring nation, Armenia. By accessing media and propoganda, the Young Turks
                        were able to spread fear of Christianity and of wealthy, educated people, also known as Armenians.
                    </p>
                    <p>After having overthrown the Sultan, the nationalist Young Turks were posed to "purify" the country by
                        destroying all of the nation's threats. Behind the curtain of World War I, the Young Turks took to
                        exterminating all non-ethnic Turks: primarily <b>the Armenians</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Turks decimated the Armenian population with mass arrests and killings. Victims were taken to the desert and painfully killed
                        by poison, gas chambers, drowning, or primitive weapons. Those who survived the torture were left
                        in the desert to rot in the blistering heat.

                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            The most well-known genocide in history is the <b>Holocaust.</b> Adolf Hitler, the leader of
                            the National Socialist party, became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, and FÃ¼rher in 1934. Hitler
                            and the Nazi party blamed the ongoing economic struggles of Germany on Jews, and through propaganda
                            and media control, were able to impose this philosophy on the German public.
                        </p>
                        <p>Quickly after Hitler came to power, he began the process of "cleansing" the German population. All
                            non-ethnic Germans, mostly Jews, were removed from the public eye, organizing them to ghettos
                            before shipping them to forced labor camps. After getting caught in the spiderweb of the Jewish
                            genocide, it was extremely difficult to get out.</p>
                        <p>Near the end of the war, Hitler's army worked hard to track down every remaining Jew. Up until Hitler's
                            own death and the end of the war, the killing continued, eventually resulting in a death toll
                            estimated between six and ten million. </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>The Cambodian genocide was yet another purification attempt of the nation of Cambodia. Rural Cambodians
                        were distraught after the countryside was destroyed by the Vietnam War. The Khmer Rouge promised
                        to return Cambodia to a simpler time, before it was contaminated with ethnically Vietnamese and Chinese
                        people, with wealth and high education.
                    </p>
                    <p>Khmer Rouge's leader, <i>Pol Pot</i>, rose to power, promising to fix Cambodia's wealth and education
                        gaps. He would do this by promoting mass killings in cities. Cities were stormed by Khmer Rouge soldiers,
                        and citydwellers were taken to labor death camps, just like the Holocaust. </p>
                    <p>The Khmer Rouge envisioned a return to the Dark Ages, before cities, medicine, art, or science. Labor
                        camps had people working 18 consecutive hours per day, with little to no food. Less fortunate prisoners
                        were killed not with weapons, but by blunt trauma, with fatal blows to the head and neck.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>For decades, the Hutu tribe of Rwanda grew extremely suspicious of another tribe, the Tutsi. After Rwanda
                        became an independent nation, the Hutus percieved that Tutsis were getting preferential treatment
                        in foreign affairs, became wealthier, and thought themselves to be superior.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the early 1990s, the Hutus began their efforts to exterminate every Tutsi in Rwanda. Hutus already
                        controlled the government, so extreme nationalist Hutus, or Interahamwe, were able to use media to
                        promote the genocidal initiative. On April 6, 1994, the Hutu president's plane was shot down, and
                        the killing began.</p>
                    <p>For 100 days, from April 7 - July 15, 1994, the Interahamwe exploded into a frenzy of mass killing, rape,
                        and torture. Since all Tutsis were forced to carry ID cards, Interahamwe killers could quickly identify
                        and destroy the enemy. Children were left without parents, and whole towns were set aflame, and the
                        residents were burned alive. </p>
